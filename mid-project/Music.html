            <p style="text-shadow: 20em;font-size:x-large;">Jay Chou</p>
            <p>I start to listen his songs when I was 8 years old. I remembered I skipped my swimming class for watching his concert in Beijing Labor Stadium.
            My favorite album is "On the run!".<br>
            <br>Here is a brief introduction for him:<br>
            <br>Jay Chou (traditional Chinese: 周杰倫; simplified Chinese: 周杰伦; pinyin: Zhōu Jiélún; born January 18, 1979)[1] is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter, record producer, rapper, actor, and television personality. Dubbed the "King of Mandopop", and having sold over 30 million records, Chou is one of the best-selling artists in Taiwan and is known for his work with lyricist Vincent Fang, with whom he has frequently collaborated on his music.
